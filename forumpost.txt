This is a tool for those video makers who want just a bit more camera movement and orientation control.

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*] Keyed pathing and playback. Create and edit keys, each of which controls the orientation and position of the camera relative to the spacecraft at a given time on the path. Path playback attempts to smoothly interpolate from one point to the next.
[*] 6-degrees-of-freedom camera controller. No longer be limited to camera positions that are simple rotations around the craft.
[*] Path recording (and playback) and camera movement while paused. This is actually an accidental feature, but one that is very handy for preparatory recording of a path or taking a screenshot while a lot of action is going on. (suggest creating and selecting the new path before pausing to workaround a glitch for now). This should also allow for cool "bullet-time" like effects (albeit with the game paused rather than slowed down).
[*] Keyframed linearly interpolated time slowdown/pausing. (bullet time effect)
[/list]
Make more videos, with greater freedom than you ever had before.

Known to work with KSP 0.21.1.

[b]Known issues:[/b] (be careful of these, they can break things)
[list]
[*] When switching from map view to flight view while KerbCam is in control of the camera, the camera will jerk around a lot. The workaround is to turn off camera control and then back on (unfortunately there isn't a game event for view changes, so this might have to be fixed by polling the camera manager).
[*] Reports of this ripping camera attachment parts from a ship. I haven't been able to reproduce this yet and haven't heard about it in [i]ages[/i]. My best guess at a workaround if it does happen would be to not start use KerbCam to control the camera or start playback whilst viewing from a fixed camera. Do inform me if you can reliably reproduce this problem and how you did it.

[list]
[*]Fix to work with KSP 0.21.1. (This also changes the code based on a better understanding of how camera transformations fit into the scene, this creates a slightly better codebase to work with)

[*]Keybindings are now configurable.
[*]Additional keybindings for the 6DoF camera. (none are set by default to avoid KerbCam making a land grab for too many keybindings that other mods might use, but I suggest binding the keypad if anything)
